# 2D-Video-Game
I have coded and designed a 2D single screen video game that includes functional WASD walking directional controls, walking sprite frames, custom sprite and back ground art, and collision boxes around the border of the display alongside various objects spread throughout the display.
The whole file containing all the code and art associated with this project is in the attatched Final Project.zip folder in this repoistory.
